# **Summary**

1. **Single Dockerfile** that installs Hadoop, Hive, HBase, Oozie, and Hue.
2. **Directory Layout** separating the main Dockerfile, config files, and scripts.
3. **Scripts** to start services in a pseudo-distributed manner.

Feel free to adapt this example to your needs. For real-world scenarios, consider:

- Multi-container or multi-node setups.
- Additional security and data-volume management.

**Enjoy exploring your single-container Hadoop + Hue environment!**
